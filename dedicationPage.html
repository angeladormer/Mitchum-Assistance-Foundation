    <p class="dedicationTitle">Gregory P. Mitchum | October 20th 1975 - December 13th 2021</p>
    <p class="dedicationText">Greg was happiest behind the camera or in front of his computer editing. The excitement his 
        eyes when he was on the road with his wife and saw an abandoned building, a beautiful sunset 
        to photograph, or packing his equipment to head out for a dark shoot at a local trail was 
        contagious.</p>
    <p class="dedicationText">Greg cherished his friendships, specifically those he acquired at Hays County. So much so 
        that one of his last instructions was to take any left over donations to our family and 
        give it back to the county. He talked in depth with Officer Treat about this, and although 
        we knew it was a tall order, we got to work quickly. The ones we asked to volunteer did not 
        bat an eye and here we are, creating a fund to help other families in need.</p>
    <p class="dedicationText">He would always lift the spirits of everyone around him regardless of what was happening at work. 
        He and Jeffrey (board member and Corrections Lieutenant) formed a closer bond after Greg's diagnosis, 
        the two were undergoing treatment for cancer. Jeffery says, "Greg was always optimistic and we would 
        continue to encourage each other during our treatment." Mindi says, "Our conversations almost always 
        ended in laughter and I could see that he loved Stacey and his family very much."</p>
    <p class="dedicationText">If you knew Greg, you knew he had a dry and sarcastic personality, which proved to be beneficial in the office. Leigh 
        (president of the board) immediately noticed Greg's work ethic and commitment to teaching. He was always early and 
        stay late to make sure everything was done. Greg had a passion for teaching others and could teach anything from basic
        to expert courses. He had a talent for making it relative and interesting. Even after his diagnosis, Greg didn't change
        his work schedule. He insisted on helping and always remained positive, he motivated the Academy Employees from a 
        position where it "should have been the reverse". They took notice of this and decided they needed to do whatever Greg
        needed during his fight. </p>
    <p class="dedicationText">Leigh says, "everytime I spoke with Greg, it was always about the future and how he could come back to work,
        which I respected and ensured we did all we could to addort him those abilities. Greg inspired up from his early
        days of being first in the office to today - where we are working to help others through him."</p>
    <p class="dedicationText">Greg will never be forgotten and we miss him everyday.</p>
