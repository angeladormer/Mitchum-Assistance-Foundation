    <p class="dedicationTitle">Gregory P. Mitchum | October 20th 1975 - December 13th 2021</p>

    <p class="dedicationText">Greg was happiest behind the camera or in front of his computer editing - the excitement in his 
        eyes when he was on the road with his wife and saw an abandoned building, a beautiful sunset 
        to photograph, or packing his equipment to head out for a dark shoot at a local trail was 
        contagious.</p>
    <p class="dedicationText">Greg cherished his friendships, specifically those he acquired at Hays County. So much so 
        that one of his last instructions was to take any left over donations to his family and 
        give it back to the county sheriffâ€™s office. He talked in depth with Officer Leigh Treat about this, and although 
        we knew it was a tall order, we got to work quickly. The ones we asked to volunteer did not 
        bat an eye and here we are, creating a fund to help other families in need!</p>
    <p class="dedicationText">He would always lift the spirits of everyone around him regardless of what was happening at work. 
        He and Jeffrey Spencer formed a closer bond after Greg's diagnosis, 
        the two were undergoing treatment for cancer. When speaking with Spencer, he mentioned, "Greg was always optimistic and we 
        would continue to encourage each other during our treatment." In agreement with Jeffrey, Mindi Duckworth says, "Our 
        conversations almost always ended in laughter, and I could see that he loved Stacey and his family very much."</p>
    <p class="dedicationText">If you knew Greg, you knew he had a dry and sarcastic personality, which proved to be beneficial 
        in the office. Treat immediately noticed Greg's work ethic and commitment to teaching. He always arrived early and 
        stayed late to make sure everything was done. Greg had a passion for teaching others and could teach anything from basic
        to expert courses. He had a talent for making it relative and interesting. Even after his diagnosis, Greg didn't change
        his work schedule - he insisted on helping and always remained positive. WHen I spoke with Treat, he said,  "Greg motivated 
        the Academy Employees from a position where it should have been the reverse."" They took notice of this and decided they 
        needed to do whatever Greg needed during his fight. </p>
    <p class="dedicationText">Greg always spoke about the future and how he could come back to work, offer free photo session for 
        families in need when he healed, and always looked for a new way to give back. Greg was an inspiration from the minute you 
        met him, and we are working to continue his legacy with this foundation. Thank you for being the man you were Greg.</p>
    <p class="dedicationText">Greg will never be forgotten and we miss him everyday.</p>
