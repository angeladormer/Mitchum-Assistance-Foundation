                    and in 2021, it proved to be one of the most difficult for the
                    Sheriff’s Office family. During the year, we lost 3 others to illnesses,
                    before we lost Greg. Greg was aware of this and after he became sick, his
                    wish was to come up with a way to help others during these extreme
                    unforeseen instances. There were multiple fundraisers for each person at
                    different times, while they were dealing with their medical issues.
                    The Hays County Sheriff’s Office family has always been willing to help
                    each other but sometimes we found it difficult to coordinate everyone.
                    We are now able to pool our resources together, in one location, to help
                    anyone at the Hays County Sheriff’s Office, with the Mitchum Assistance
                    Foundation.

                    promoted the position of Corrections Lieutenant. In my free time, I enjoy
                    spending time with my family, going on motorcycle rides, traveling, and
                    listening to music. I look forward to the growth of this foundation in
                    assisting the fellow brothers and sisters of Hays County.

                    I remember being blown away when Greg told me that he and his wife Stacey make homemade pasta! Something 
                    I could never do!

                    around his family, his 'extended' family of HCSO and his friends - something that inspires me daily. I am a 
                    professional software engineer, and was honored to be able to use my skillsets alongside my wife Angie to create 
                    this page in his memory so that he could continue to help others as he so loved doing.
